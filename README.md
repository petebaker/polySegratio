**polySegratio:** Simulate and test marker dosage for dominant markers in autopolyploids

Perform classic chi-squared tests and Ripol et al(1999) binomial confidence interval approach for autopolyploid dominant markers. Also, dominant markers may be generated for families of offspring where either one or both of the parents possess the marker. Missing values and misclassified markers may be generated at random.

	Maintenance release: I am no longer working in polyploids.
